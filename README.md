# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
An interactive Machine Learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts house prices using multiple regression models. This project allows users to upload datasets, explore data visually, compare model performance, and predict house prices for new inputs — all through a clean and intuitive user interface.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location-related factors, and more.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, making it suitable for students, beginners, and ML enthusiasts who want to understand end-to-end machine learning workflow — from data upload to prediction.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

This project implements and compares the following models:

• Linear Regression

  • Simple and interpretable baseline model
  
• Random Forest Regressor

  • Ensemble-based model for better accuracy
  
• XGBoost Regressor

  • Advanced gradient boosting model for high performance
  
Each model is evaluated and compared to help users understand which algorithm performs best on their dataset.


🖥️ Features of the Web App

✅ Upload your own housing dataset (CSV format)

✅ Automatic data preprocessing

✅ Interactive data visualization (feature relationships & trends)

✅ Train multiple ML models with a single click

✅ Compare model performance using evaluation metrics

✅ Predict house prices for new/unseen data

✅ Clean, responsive, and intuitive Streamlit UI




📊 Data Visualization

The app provides visual insights such as:

 • Feature vs Price relationships
 
 • Correlation analysis
 
 • Graphical comparison of model predictions
 
These visualizations help users understand the dataset and model behavior better.
